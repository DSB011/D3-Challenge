## Objective

I wanted to showcase how health risk factors (smoking, obesity and healtcare access) and differnet demographics (poverty level, household income and age) can affect people's lives by using D3 Visualization. I created a scatter plot to vizually compare how healthcare vs Poverty in differnet demographics are affected in each US State.

## Dataset

The data was taken from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and its based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.

## Visulaization

Created a scatter plot between Healthcare vs. Poverty that represents each state with circle elements using D3 techniques.
